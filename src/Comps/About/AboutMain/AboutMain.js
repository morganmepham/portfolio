            <p className="about-main-text1">I am a Front-end Developer and UI/UX Designer based in Cardiff, Wales. My web journey began at 12 years old when I was inspired by the classic “hacker” character in films and TV shows. What I found wasn't anything like the films... I was captivated by my first “Hello World” program and subsequent first website. I haven't looked back since.</p>

            <p className="about-main-text2">My experience includes freelance work and personal projects, both of which have increased my skills and ability. I'm extremely passionate about my work and personal development in the field. My organization and problem-solving skills have been refined by pushing myself every time I hit the keyboard. No task is too big or complicated with the right preparation and patience. There is no limit to my curiosity and interest in front-end development, this means that I'm always looking for new ways to expand my skill set and knowledge.</p>
